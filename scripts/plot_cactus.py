"""Draw a cactus plot from the benchmark-comparison CSVs.

A cactus plot answers "how many instances can each solver finish within a
per-instance time budget": for each solver, sort its solved instances by
runtime and plot the running count against that runtime. Further right and
lower is better -- a solver whose curve stays flat and then rises steeply is
solving most instances quickly.

Two things this script insists on, because a cactus plot is easy to draw
dishonestly:

* **Only rows that actually answered `sat` or `unsat` count as solved.** A
  timeout is not a data point on the curve; neither is a crash or an
  unsupported input -- and neither is a clean `unknown`. That last one is not
  hypothetical: primo exits with status `ok` and answer `unknown` when QF_LIA
  branch-and-bound hits its node limit, 750 times per arm on the 13,306-file
  division, while cvc5 and z3 never do. Scoring `status == ok` would have
  drawn primo's curve 750 instances above the truth and inverted a standing it
  is actually behind on (2026-08-26).
* **Non-standard failures are reported separately and loudly.** A benchmark we
  could not parse is a frontend gap, not a performance result, and it must not
  disappear into the gap between a curve and the instance count. See
  docs/experiments.md.

Solvers may come from different result directories -- a reference solver that
has not changed should not be re-run (see docs/experiments.md) -- so the
provenance of each series is recorded in the caption rather than implied.

``--drop-solved-by-all-under S`` removes the instances every series solved in
under S seconds. This is a presentation change, not a scoring one: an instance
every solver finishes quickly contributes exactly one point to every curve, so
dropping it subtracts the same constant from all of them. Every gap between
curves survives untouched while the vertical range stops being dominated by
the shared easy majority. What it does change is PAR2 and the solved counts,
which are then computed over the retained instances only -- so the printed
table and the legend are counts *of the hard subset*, and the caption says so.
Numbers from a filtered plot are not comparable with numbers from a full one.

Example:
    python3 scripts/plot_cactus.py \\
        --series primo=results/div-118904 --series yices=results/div-118904 \\
        --series z3=results/div-118382 --series cvc5=results/div-118382 \\
        --series opensmt=results/div-119045 \\
