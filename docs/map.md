# Explore Primo and find a contribution

Use this map to connect the solver's parts with explanations and open questions.
Each card links to what exists today and a possible investigation. **Open leads
are proposals, not implemented features or assigned tasks.** Read a lead's scope
and evidence before choosing work.

For the supported input boundary, start with the [capability map](capabilities.md).
For a first run, use the [getting-started guide](guide/getting-started.md).

## Follow a query

This follows the default rebuild route for formulas without quantifiers.
The search repeatedly consults theory solvers; it is not a single forward pass. Quantified input has
its own route, shown below. Retained sessions have additional lifetime and
backtracking requirements.

## Choose a kind of contribution

A useful first contribution can be a focused test, explanation, or measurement.
A solver optimization needs a justified mechanism and fresh correctness and
performance evidence before acceptance.

| If you enjoy… | A concrete starting point | How to proceed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explaining difficult ideas | Work through an example in a chapter and identify a missing derivation or ambiguous term. | [Documentation workflow](development/documentation.md) |
| Finding counterexamples | Exercise a boundary such as backtracking, resource limits, or reconstruction after elimination. | [Fuzzing and reduction](development/fuzzing.md) |
| Experimental work | Investigate one bottleneck or an unresolved provenance/checking task. | [Reproducible experiments](development/experiments.md) and [open evidence work](work/evidence.md) |
| Algorithms and proofs | Choose a lead, read its primary sources, and specify invariants and unsupported cases before implementation. | [Research register](leads/index.md) and [literature map](literature.md) |
| APIs and data structures | Audit ownership or prototype an external library consumer before proposing interface changes. | [Library API lead](leads/library-api.md) and [contribution requirements](development/contributing-changes.md) |

The [correctness requirements](development/correctness.md) apply across these
areas. In the maintainer's workspace, solver batches, fuzzing, and benchmarks
belong in SLURM; contributors may use a suitable machine. The
[experiment workflow](development/experiments.md) explains preparation and
recording results. A card is a starting point, not a claim that its investigation
is small or ready for implementation.

## Find the rest of the manual

- **Use the solver:** [input](guide/input.md), [models](guide/models.md), and [sessions](guide/sessions.md).
- **Look up exact behavior:** [options](reference/options.md), [effective policies](reference/policies.md), and [tactic inventory](reference/tactics.md).
- **Understand the design:** [architecture](implementation/architecture.md) and [primary literature](literature.md).
- **Find proposals and ongoing work:** [open leads](leads/index.md), [documentation work](work/documentation.md), and [results storage](work/results-storage.md).
- **Assess claims and history:** [evaluation evidence](evidence/evaluation-refresh.md), [documentation review](review.md), and [preservation map](coverage/index.md).
