# Literature and implementation mapping

The [bibliography](references.md) identifies publications; this page explains
where their algorithmic content belongs. A citation or reading note does not
establish that an entire algorithm is implemented. The owning implementation
chapter states the actual subset, deviations, invariants and tests.

## SAT, EUF, and Boolean structure

| Source or topic | Current role and retained reading note |
| --- | --- |
| IPASIR-UP | [SAT integration](implementation/sat.md) owns callbacks, reasons and the adapter boundary. The {source}`interface reading note <docs/papers/ipasir-up.md>` retains the paper checklist; Primo delegates propositional search. |
| Nieuwenhuis–Oliveras, fast congruence closure | [EUF](implementation/euf.md) maps flattening, congruence, explanation and rollback to Primo. The {source}`algorithm note <docs/papers/fast-congruence-closure.md>` and {source}`implementation comparison <docs/papers/fast-congruence-closure-implementation.md>` preserve optimizations not adopted wholesale. |
| CVC4 architecture | [Combination](implementation/combination.md) explains care pairs and the general component interface. The {source}`reading note <docs/papers/cvc4-architecture.md>` is architectural context, not a copied implementation. |
| Yices | [Survey](papers/yices.md): dynamic Ackermannization and theory-lemma reuse are distinct from Primo's existing bounded propagators. |
| Clause forgetting | [Survey](papers/clause-forgetting.md): logical redundancy, reason lifetime and termination are separate obligations. |
| Plaisted–Greenbaum and SMT encodings | [Survey](papers/polarity-aware-cnf.md): direction-sensitive definitions remain an open extension; the rejected root-only prototype is retained history. |
| Relevance and don't-cares | [Survey](papers/relevance-filtering.md) and [quantifier relevance](leads/quantifier-relevance.md): deciding which obligation matters differs from filtering instances of an active obligation. |

## Arithmetic papers and theses

| Source | Current role and retained reading note |
| --- | --- |
| Arithmetic symmetry | [Open lead and reading scope](leads/arithmetic-symmetry.md): SyMT detection results, CVC4-SymBreak, and related LP/ILP work. These motivate investigation beyond the current finite-choice pass; they do not establish a QF_LIA/QF_LRA speedup for Primo. |
| Dutertre–de Moura, integrating simplex with DPLL(T) | [LRA](implementation/lra.md) covers preparation, bound repair, strict arithmetic, conflicts and rollback. The {source}`base-paper checklist <docs/papers/fast-linear-arithmetic-dpllt.md>` records departures and later optional methods. |
| Tim King, *Effective Algorithms for the Satisfiability of Quantifier-Free Formulas Over Linear Real and Integer Arithmetic*, PhD thesis, 2014 | LRA sparse operations, finite fallback, SOI and conflict construction. [The chapter's source table](implementation/lra.md#sources-and-implementation-status) distinguishes Primo's representation from the complete thesis designs. |
| Alberto Griggio, *An Effective SMT Engine for Formal Verification*, PhD thesis, 2009 | Sparse engineering, violation selection and early-pruning context. The {source}`thesis note <docs/papers/griggio-mathsat-thesis.md>` retains exact sections and the corrected least-violated attribution. |
| Martin Bromberger, *Decision Procedures for Linear Arithmetic*, PhD thesis, 2019 | [Reading guide](papers/bromberger-linear-arithmetic.md), [LIA](implementation/lia.md) and [preprocessing](implementation/preprocessing.md). Complete equality bases, cube/bounding methods and other unimplemented algorithms remain comparisons/leads. The {source}`original thesis checklist <docs/papers/bromberger-linear-arithmetic-thesis.md>` retains the full intake. |
| Monniaux, CAV 2009 | LRA normalization, direct bounds and sparse-pivot motivation. [Floating-point assistance](leads/lra-floating-point.md) is unimplemented; leading-coefficient-one normalization differs from the paper's integer normalization. |
| King–Barrett–Dutertre, SOI | LRA's optional SOI section states the implemented objective, breakpoint method, conflict explanation and finite fallback; it does not describe the default sparse repair loop. |
| Bjørner–Nachmanson, *Arithmetic Solving in Z3* | LRA's optional model-unit producer and LIA's selected patching/GCD/cut mechanisms. The {source}`paper map <docs/papers/arithmetic-solving-in-z3.md>` preserves broader unimplemented integer/nonlinear procedures. |
| Word GCD and integer divisibility | [LIA](implementation/lia.md) states row integrality preconditions; {source}`word-GCD notes <docs/papers/word-gcd-notes.md>` are an engineering comparison, not the origin of the mathematical divisibility test. |
| Integer division and modulo | [LIA](implementation/lia.md) and [preprocessing](implementation/preprocessing.md) describe the constant-divisor subset; the {source}`reading note <docs/papers/integer-division-and-modulo.md>` retains excluded variants. |
| LP/MIP presolve and primal heuristics | [Repair survey](papers/lia-primal-heuristics.md), [patching lead](leads/lia-patching.md), and {source}`monotone-elimination note <docs/papers/monotone-variable-elimination.md>` keep rounding/repair and elimination obligations distinct. |
| Atom canonicalization | Current normalization is explained in preprocessing and LRA; {source}`the comparison note <docs/papers/lra-atom-canonicalization.md>` retains rejected/default-off policy evidence. |
| Difference constraints | {source}`Reading note <docs/papers/difference-constraint-propagation.md>` motivates a future dedicated route. It is not implemented difference-logic admission. |

The {source}`arithmetic related-work index <docs/papers/lra-related-work.md>`
retains additional comparisons. [Arithmetic evidence](evidence/arithmetic.md)
separates implementation choices from the measurements that accepted or rejected
them. [Primo's published results](papers/primo-qflra-results.md) have their own
configuration and unresolved artifact mapping.

## Preprocessing, strategies, and combination

| Source/topic | Current role and retained note |
| --- | --- |
| de Moura–Passmore, *The Strategy Challenge in SMT Solving* | [Tactics](implementation/tactics.md) maps §3 to Primo's formula-valued composition and model conversion, with explicit limits. |
| FastSMT and tactic configuration | The {source}`FastSMT note <docs/papers/fastsmt-strategy-synthesis.md>` and {source}`configuration evidence <docs/papers/tactic-configuration-evidence.md>` motivate future strategy selection. Primo has no implemented learned strategy system or parallel tactic scheduler. |
| Symmetry breaking and value precedence | [Preprocessing](implementation/preprocessing.md) states the finite-domain/permutation conditions. The {source}`symmetry note <docs/papers/smt-symmetry-breaking.md>` and {source}`finite-model note <docs/papers/finite-model-finding-sorts.md>` retain broader comparisons; Primo is not a general finite-model finder. |
| Nelson–Oppen closure methods | [Combination](implementation/combination.md) explains shared variables, equality exchange and completeness assumptions; the {source}`closure note <docs/papers/nelson-oppen-closure-methods.md>` is the retained algorithm intake. |
| de Moura–Bjørner, model-based combination | The {source}`reading note <docs/papers/model-based-theory-combination.md>` and current combination chapter distinguish model mutation, guessed equalities, explanations, and exact fallback. This is separate from Ge–de Moura MBQI. |
| MathSAT5; Bjørner–Fazekas incremental preprocessing | [Sessions](implementation/sessions.md) maps labels and safe preprocessing restrictions. Restoration/replay algorithms remain [open work](leads/incremental-equations.md). |

## Quantifiers, syntax, and testing

Reynolds, Barbosa and Fontaine's enumerative-instantiation results and Janota,
Barbosa, Fontaine and Reynolds's tuple-order work are mapped in
[quantifiers](implementation/quantifiers.md). The
{source}`enumeration note <docs/papers/enumerative-instantiation.md>` and
{source}`tuple-order note <docs/papers/fair-adventurous-enumeration.md>` preserve
their reading checklists and historical evaluations. Entailment filtering,
fail masks, equality representatives, model-refining filters and Ge–de Moura
MBQI are distinct proposals in [quantifier leads](leads/quantifier-instantiation.md).
The old statement that an `unknown` from one order is logically “weaker” is
superseded: every `unknown` is inconclusive; fairness concerns the unbounded
enumeration procedure, not a hierarchy of bounded `unknown` answers.

The chapter also maps Andrew Reynolds's 2013 thesis, *Finite Model Finding in
Satisfiability Modulo Theories*, §§3.1.1–3.1.2, and Haniel Barbosa's 2017 thesis,
*New Techniques for Instantiation and Proof Production in SMT Solving*, §5.1
and §§7.1.1–7.1.2. These supply the finite-model/instantiation distinction and
formula-processing comparisons; Primo does not implement their complete
finite-model-finding or proof-production frameworks.

SMT-LIB 2.7 supplies the syntax/binding/session specification used by
[frontend](implementation/frontend.md) and [sessions](implementation/sessions.md).
Robert Daniel Brummayer's 2009 PhD thesis, Chapter 4, grounds
[fuzzing and reduction](development/correctness.md#fuzzing-and-reduction-sources).
The {source}`general reading summaries <docs/papers/summaries.md>` and
{source}`original literature register <docs/literature.md>` retain initial
questions and comparisons. Their old milestone language does not override
the current capability or lead registers.

## Maintaining the reading record

Publication identity belongs in the bibliography, not an ignored PDF filename.
For new work, read the relevant primary section and record operations, data,
invariants, cost assumptions, proof obligations, tests, and implemented subset.
If the required source is unavailable, record the access blocker rather than
substituting another solver's implementation or a secondary summary.
