# Linear real arithmetic

This theory follows the [shared assignment and explanation contract](theory-interface.md#theories-and-their-shared-contract).
Its dedicated arithmetic checks and online callbacks currently provide that
integration; the Real routes do not all use the `TheoryComponent` C++ interface.
The [interface inventory](theory-interface.md#which-interface-is-used) and
[combination routes](combination.md#the-shared-smt-driver) distinguish those paths.

Primo's linear real arithmetic solver checks whether the inequalities selected
by SAT have a common solution. It maintains exact values satisfying a fixed
system of linear equations, then repairs violations of the selected bounds.
Failure produces a clause explaining which Boolean assignments cannot hold
together. The [DPLL(T) chapter](dpllt.md) describes how SAT uses that clause.

The implementation follows Dutertre and de Moura's
[Integrating Simplex with DPLL(T)](https://yices.csl.sri.com/papers/sri-csl-06-01.pdf),
with substantial engineering described below: shared polynomial rows, direct
bounds, small-rational arithmetic, sparse pivoting, occurrence indices, deferred
checks and bounds-only rollback. Section numbers for this source refer to the
**technical report**, whose numbering differs from the CAV paper.

The [integer-arithmetic companion](lia.md) explains how the pure and combined
integer routes use this tableau as a real relaxation, then apply patching,
GCD checks, Gomory cuts and branching. It covers their explanations, budgets
and incomplete cases; [its preservation map](../coverage/lia.md) retains
the dated experiments separately.

## Representation and ownership

The input to arithmetic preparation is typed core terms plus their Boolean
abstraction. The tableau itself receives variable IDs, exact bounds and reason
literals. It does not parse SMT-LIB or inspect the SAT solver's internals.

| Representation | Owner, identity and lifetime |
| --- | --- |
| {source}`LinearPolynomial <src/theory/arithmetic/linear_polynomial.hpp>` | Owns a constant and a map from `TermId` to nonzero rational coefficients. Repeated occurrences add; exact cancellation removes an entry. |
| {source}`LraAtom <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_atom.hpp>` | Owns a normalized polynomial, relation `Le`, `Lt` or `Eq`, and right-hand-side rational. It is a value, not a SAT literal. |
| {source}`PreparedLraTheory <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L3332-L3388>` | Borrows the term manager and owns the base tableau, term-to-variable map, polynomial-to-slack map, and prepared atom vector. Each atom retains its own threshold and orientation. |
| {source}`LraVarId <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.hpp#L17>` | A numeric index local to a tableau and its structurally matching copies. It denotes an input leaf or an auxiliary polynomial value, independently of core and SAT IDs. |
| {source}`LraTableau <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.hpp>` | Owns assignments, bounds with reasons, basic/nonbasic membership, sparse rows, reverse occurrences, violated-variable set and undo records. |
| {source}`OnlineLraPropagator <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L6972-L7063>` | Borrows prepared data and owns a working tableau copied from the base, decision-level checkpoints, pending consequences and retained reasons. It reads the shared SAT assignment view. |

The term manager must outlive preparation and any interpretation of its IDs.
Tableau IDs survive pivots and rollback; being basic is a mutable property of
the variable. Structural insertion allocates vectors and maps, and pivots can
replace entire rows. References into these containers must not survive such
mutations. Copying a tableau preserves its numbering but creates independent
mutable arithmetic state.

The usual preparation installs equations before search. `append_atom` can
extend the prepared base between SAT calls, for example for a new interface
equality. This is separate from asserting a bound on the live tableau;
`add_row` is not a trailed search operation.

## From atoms to bounds

{source}`LinearPolynomial::from_term <src/theory/arithmetic/linear_polynomial.cpp#L12-L50>`
collects additions and constant scaling. Core `Times` stores a rational
coefficient and one child, so it represents linear scaling. Arithmetic leaves
are identified by their `TermId`; any uninterpreted application needs the
surrounding combination machinery to enforce its function semantics.
Unlowered `ite`, `div`, `mod` and `abs` raise an exception at this boundary.

{source}`normalize_atom <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_atom.cpp#L10-L37>` subtracts
the right side and moves the constant to the threshold. Preparation then
orders variables by `TermId` and divides every coefficient and the threshold
by the first coefficient, making that coefficient one. A negative divisor
reverses the inequality. This canonicalization
identifies proportional polynomials; it does not merge their SAT variables.

For example, these predicates can share the variable `s = x + y`:

| Predicate | Bound when true |
| --- | --- |
| `x + y <= 5` | `s <= 5` |
| `2*x + 2*y <= 10` | `s <= 5` |
| `-x - y <= -5` | `s >= 5` |
| `x + y <= 7` | `s <= 7` |

The thresholds and SAT reasons stay separate, including when a predicate is
assigned false. A single-variable polynomial instead becomes a direct bound:
`2*x <= 10` needs `x <= 5`, with no auxiliary variable or equation.
{source}`PreparedLraTheory::append_atom <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L3411-L3514>`
implements both savings: bounds on a single variable use that variable
directly, while bounds on proportional compound polynomials share one
auxiliary variable and its defining row. This keeps the tableau smaller and
puts related bounds on the same variable, where they can be compared directly.

Monniaux's [CAV 2009 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3525), §2.1, describes
both ideas, but chooses a different standard form for the coefficients.
The paper clears denominators and removes common integer factors, choosing
the sign so the first coefficient is positive. Primo divides by the first
coefficient, so it becomes exactly one; the remaining coefficients may be
fractions. For example, assuming `x` comes before `y` in the variable order:

| Input | Paper's integer form | Primo's form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `4*x + 6*y <= 10` | `2*x + 3*y <= 5` | `x + (3/2)*y <= 5/2` |

The paper's coefficients `2` and `3` have greatest common divisor one: this
is what “coprime integer coefficients” means here. Both forms express the
same inequality and give proportional polynomials a common representation.
In both cases the threshold must be scaled by the same factor as the
coefficients.

Leading-coefficient normalization gives Primo a simple way to share rows.
{source}`canonical_polynomial <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L3296-L3313>` uses
one coefficient as the divisor for every term and the threshold, skipping
those divisions when it is already one. It needs no separate
common-denominator or greatest-common-divisor computation across the vector;
individual rational operations still reduce their results.

The tradeoff is that this can introduce fractions into an initially integer
row. Coprime-integer normalization avoids those initial fractions, but clearing
input denominators can enlarge coefficients, and later pivots can introduce
fractions again. There is no recorded direct performance comparison of the
two normal forms; the [normalization review](../review-history.md#why-leading-coefficient-normalization-was-chosen)
records the original row-sharing objective and available evidence. Choosing
an initial normal form and maintaining integer rows throughout pivoting are
separate design questions.

Primo also has a separate, optional
{source}`early atom canonicalizer <src/smt/preprocessing.cpp#L499-L599>` that
uses coprime integer coefficients in core terms, so equivalent predicates can
share a SAT atom. It is
{source}`off by default <src/smt/check_sat.hpp#L321-L324>`. Even when enabled,
tableau preparation still applies leading-coefficient division. The
{source}`early canonicalization note <docs/papers/lra-atom-canonicalization.md>`
describes that separate transformation and its evaluation.

Real equality is lowered to two inequalities before this path. Negating it
gives a Boolean choice between strict inequalities, handled by SAT. The
low-level `Eq` case's rejection of a false equality is therefore not a
restriction on surface Real disequality. See the
{source}`equality-lowering design <docs/arithmetic.md#L130-L173>` and
{source}`bound assertion boundary <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L3222-L3254>`.

## Exact numbers and strict bounds

{source}`util::Rational <src/util/rational.hpp#L197-L199>` uses an inline signed
64-bit numerator and denominator for values fitting its small representation.
Operations use checked wide intermediates and fall back to GMP rationals.
Results that fit return to the small representation: equal values must compare
and hash alike regardless of the arithmetic path that produced them.
This is the two-tier representation discussed by Monniaux §4 and Griggio
§2.5.2, with 64-bit rather than Monniaux's 32-bit small values. The paper's
floating-point solver and forced-pivoting algorithm remain an
[open lead: floating-point-guided basis selection](../leads/lra-floating-point.md).

The [compact rational storage lead](../leads/rational-storage.md) investigates
overlapping the small numerator and owned big-number pointer. It includes a
reproducible layout probe and the remaining ownership and evaluation questions.

A strict bound uses an exact symbolic infinitesimal.
{source}`DeltaRational <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.hpp#L24-L56>` stores
two rationals `(q, k)`, interpreted as `q + k*δ`, ordered lexicographically.
There is no floating-point tolerance. For an unflipped Real atom:

| Atom | Assigned true | Assigned false |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `t <= c` | upper bound `(c, 0)` | lower bound `(c, 1)` |
| `t < c` | upper bound `(c, -1)` | lower bound `(c, 0)` |

The flipped orientation reverses the bound direction. All cases are centralized
in {source}`bound_assertion <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L3119-L3187>`.
Integer tightening is a separate branch of this function; the infinitesimal
interpretation here is for Real arithmetic. The basis is Dutertre–de Moura
§3.3, including the argument that a sufficiently small positive rational
can replace `δ` in a satisfying model.

## Sparse rows and reverse occurrences

A basic variable is defined by a row `x_b = Σ a_bj*x_j` over nonbasic
variables. The row contains only nonzero coefficients, in increasing variable
order, with one entry per variable. The actual entry is
{source}`RowEntry {var, coeff, occ_slot} <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.hpp#L290-L295>`.
Its reverse link satisfies:

```text
For entry e in rows_[b]:  occurs_in_[e.var][e.occ_slot] == b
```

`occurs_in_[v]` lists the basic rows containing `v`. Its order is immaterial.
`occ_slot` locates the column occurrence, not the row entry. Removing an
occurrence swaps the last column element into its place and repairs that
element's row backlink using binary search. Thus
{source}`unlink_occurrence <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L2004-L2024>`
avoids scanning the column, but repair is logarithmic in the moved row's
length. It is not the constant-time unlink of a doubly linked matrix.

```{figure} ../_static/lra-tableau-occurrence-index.svg
:alt: Sorted tableau rows linked by occ_slot to unordered column occurrence lists, with swap-pop removal and backlink repair.

Sorted rows and their reverse occurrence index. Each row entry's `occ_slot`
locates its entry in a column list; `occ` abbreviates `occurs_in_`.
The {source}`editable TikZ source <docs/figures/lra-tableau-occurrence-index.tex>`
is retained with the figure.
```

The distinction among the thesis representations matters. King §2.2.7 uses
unsorted, doubly linked rows and columns, with a dense scratch map for row
addition. Griggio §2.5.2 discusses sorted contiguous coefficient arrays.
Bromberger §7.1.4 uses sorted doubly linked rows, unordered columns and a
common denominator per row. Primo uses sorted vectors, individual rational
coefficients and the indexed occurrences above. These designs support the
same sparse operations with different allocation and removal costs.

{source}`pivot <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L143-L315>` merges sorted
rows, drops exact cancellations and updates occurrences only when membership
changes. The coefficient merge is linear in the two row lengths; occurrence
repairs and arbitrary-precision arithmetic add their own costs. Updating a
nonbasic assignment visits its dependent rows through `occurs_in_`, but the
current {source}`update <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L97-L141>` still
searches each affected row for the coefficient. The occurrence index is not
a direct pointer to that coefficient.

The 32-bit occurrence slot assumes fewer than `2^32` occurrences in a column.
The representation and its capacity assumption are distinct from SAT literal
encoding. Hash-consing core terms does not bound either quantity.

## Repairing an assignment

Dutertre–de Moura §3.2 separates three obligations:

1. Every assignment satisfies the tableau equations.
2. Every nonbasic variable satisfies its current bounds.
3. After a successful `check()`, basic variables satisfy their bounds too.

{source}`assert_upper and assert_lower <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L47-L95>`
tighten a bound and save its predecessor on the undo trail. A weaker bound
does nothing. A new upper bound below the current lower bound, or conversely,
returns an immediate conflict without installing the contradictory bound.
If a nonbasic value falls outside a new bound, `update` moves it to that bound
and updates dependent basic values. Basic variables may then need repair.

For the ordinary repair policies,
{source}`check <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L1797-L1894>` selects a
violated basic variable and a nonbasic variable that can move in the required
direction. It pivots the latter into the basis, then moves the now-nonbasic
leaving variable to its violated bound. For example, pivoting `y` into the
row `s = x + y` yields `y = s - x`; setting `s` to its target updates `y`
and every other row depending on `s`. Each pivot preserves the equations.
If no eligible entering variable exists, current bounds prevent repairing
that row, and the solver explains a conflict.

The solver's default is **Sparse**, although a directly constructed
`LraTableau` defaults to Bland. The
{source}`solver options <src/smt/check_sat.hpp#L282-L294>` select the policy:

| Policy | Implemented choice |
| --- | --- |
| Default sparse leaving | Shortest violated row; greatest violation breaks ties. |
| Sparse entering | Fewest column occurrences among eligible candidates considered; unit coefficient, then variable ID break ties. By default, compare at most 16 eligible candidates. The scan may visit more entries to find them. |
| Optional least-violated leaving | Griggio §2.5.3: smallest violation first, then shortest row. This overrides the default leaving policy under Sparse. |
| Optional Dantzig | Greatest violation first; largest absolute entering coefficient, with variable IDs breaking ties. |
| Bland | Smallest eligible variable IDs on both sides; also the termination fallback. |
| Optional SOI | Maintains a joint objective for all current violations; see [sum of infeasibilities](#lra-soi). |

Monniaux §3 also describes preferring shorter rows and fewer column
occurrences to reduce pivot cost, in the context of forced pivoting. Primo's
sparse policy applies that rationale to ordinary feasibility search;
it does not import the surrounding floating-point/forced-pivot procedure.
King §2.2.12 provides the direct comparison for minimum-column selection
and eventual Bland fallback in SMT.

Heuristic selection eventually switches to Bland within each `check()` call.
The default threshold is `4 * variable_count + 64`; this is a tuning choice,
not a bound on the total pivots needed. King §2.2.12 explains why eventual
Bland selection matters. The selection scan must still find an eligible
candidate beyond an unproductive row prefix; otherwise a cost cap could
become an incorrect conflict. See
{source}`select_entering_variable <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L901-L986>`.

## Follow a strict conflict

Let SAT assign `p`, `q` and `r` true for:

```text
p: x + y <= 2       q: x >= 2       r: y > 0
```

Preparation supplies `s = x + y`, initially with all values zero. The
following is a trace of theory operations, not a prescribed SAT search order:

| Operation | Assignment and bounds |
| --- | --- |
| Assert `p` | Install `s <= 2`, carrying reason `¬p`. |
| Assert `q` | Install `x >= 2`, carrying `¬q`; update `x = 2`, hence `s = 2`. |
| Assert `r` | Install `y >= δ`, carrying `¬r`; update `y = δ`, hence `s = 2 + δ`. |
| Check the violated row | `s` is too high. Decreasing either `x` or `y` is blocked by its lower bound, so no repair pivot is possible. |

The row and the two lower bounds imply `s >= 2 + δ`, contradicting `s <= 2`.
The resulting clause is `¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r`.

Primo stores **the negation of the asserting SAT literal** with each bound,
at the {source}`assignment boundary <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7302-L7310>`.
{source}`build_conflict <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L433-L446>`
collects the violated bound's reason and the row bounds that block movement.
It returns clause literals directly; the caller must not negate them again.
This is the row-based explanation of Dutertre–de Moura §3.2.2. The returned
object is a SAT clause, not an exported proof certificate with coefficients.

## Propagation and online checking

Arithmetic propagation proves the value of an existing Boolean atom from
active bounds and the tableau equations. It returns that literal with an
explanation clause. [Equality exchange](combination.md#explained-equality-exchange)
uses the same implication-to-clause principle to communicate consequences
between theories; its conclusions are equalities of shared terms.

### Bounds on the same variable

Default propagation compares predicates bounding the same tableau variable.
For instance, `p: s <= 2` entails `t: s <= 5`, with reason clause `¬p ∨ t`.
{source}`scan_for_propagations <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7554-L7600>` visits
the prepared `atoms_by_bound_var` index and checks both polarities of each
unassigned atom. It uses bounds, not accidental equalities in the current
candidate assignment. This is the cheap propagation of the technical report's
§3.2.5.

### Deriving a bound from a row

Optional row propagation combines bounds on several variables. Consider the
current tableau row

```text
s = 2*x - 3*y + z
```

Here `s` is basic and `x`, `y`, `z` are nonbasic; the equation is an identity
maintained by pivoting, not an extra SAT assumption. Let `l(v)` and `u(v)`
denote the active lower and upper bounds on variable `v`. Multiplication by
a negative coefficient reverses order, so the bound used for each contribution
depends on its sign:

| Coefficient of `v` | Upper-bound contribution | Lower-bound contribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a > 0` | `a*u(v)` | `a*l(v)` |
| `a < 0` | `a*l(v)` | `a*u(v)` |

Thus this row gives

```text
upper(s) = 2*u(x) - 3*l(y) + u(z)
lower(s) = 2*l(x) - 3*u(y) + l(z)
```

These are candidate implied bounds; they need not be the strongest bounds
entailed by the whole problem. {source}`compute_implied_bound
<src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L6854-L6879>` computes one direction at a time
with exact `DeltaRational` arithmetic and collects the reasons of the selected
bounds. It reads bounds, not the current model's values of `x`, `y` and `z`.

For a concrete upper bound, suppose SAT literals `p`, `q`, `r` assert
`x <= 4`, `y >= 1`, `z <= 2`. The contributions are at most 8, −3 and 2,
respectively, so `s <= 7`. If an unassigned atom has literal `t` and means
`s <= 8`, this entails `t` with the clause

```text
not p or not q or not r or t
```

The threshold may be weaker than the computed bound: `7 <= 8` suffices.
For a lower-bound query the comparison reverses. The
{source}`entailment check <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7601-L7615>` makes this
comparison against the bound imposed by each possible truth value of the
target atom. It can therefore propagate the negation of an atom as well.

The same calculation handles strict bounds using the
[infinitesimal convention](#exact-numbers-and-strict-bounds). Replacing `x <= 4`
by `x < 4` contributes `2*(4 - δ)` and gives `s <= 7 - 2*δ`. This is strong
enough to imply the atom `s < 7`, whose upper bound is `7 - δ`.

### Bounding a row variable in reverse

The optional reverse direction isolates a nonbasic variable rather than the
row's basic variable. In a separate candidate with the same row, let literals
`a`, `b`, `c` assert `s <= 1`, `x >= 2`, `z >= 0`. Isolating `y` gives

```text
-3*y = s - 2*x - z <= 1 - 2*2 - 0 = -3
   y >= 1
```

Dividing by −3 reverses the inequality. If literal `v` represents the
unassigned atom `y >= 1`, its explanation is
`not a or not b or not c or v`. This derivation uses the bound on `s` and
the other row variables; it does not need an existing bound on `y`.

In general, for `s = k*y + sum(k_j*x_j)` with nonzero `k`, isolate
`y = (s - sum(k_j*x_j))/k`. Choose the numerator's upper or lower bound
according to the requested direction and the sign of `k`, then apply the
coefficient rule above to the subtracted terms. This is
{source}`compute_implied_child_bound <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L6893-L6930>`.
It returns a derived value and the clause literals explaining the selected
bounds, without pivoting to make `y` basic.

### Delivery, triggers and limits

Both helpers retain the bounds' **already negated premise literals**: the
forward example stores `not p`, `not q`, `not r`. The
{source}`delivery and reason callbacks <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7115-L7180>`
return the target literal and these clause literals without negating them again.
The propagator owns the queued candidates and delivered reasons, following the
[explanation lifetime](dpllt.md#reason-lifetime-is-separate-from-clause-retention)
rules. A row identity needs no SAT premise;
changing basis does not invalidate the identity used to derive the clause.

The implementation uses derived bounds to test already registered atoms. It
does not install every derived numeric bound or iterate interval refinement
to a fixed point. Only when SAT assigns a propagated atom does its bound enter
the usual assignment path and become available for further propagation.
In the forward example, deriving `s <= 7` proves the existing atom `s <= 8`.
Assigning that atom submits the bound 8 to the tableau, not the derived bound
7; an already stronger stored bound remains in force.

After a nonconflicting assigned bound, the
{source}`notification hook <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7340-L7347>` invokes
the optional row scan. {source}`scan_row_based_propagations
<src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7630-L7668>` follows `occurs_in(changed_var)` to
rows containing the changed variable. It skips rows without indexed atoms on
their basic variable; otherwise it tests those atoms and, when enabled, runs
the reverse scan over atoms on the other row variables.
This is selective scheduling: a change to a basic variable's own bound alone
does not visit its defining row through `occurs_in`. In the reverse example,
a subsequent bound notification for `x` or `z` can trigger the calculation
once the needed bounds are present. Pivots do not themselves run this scan.

Missing bounds and cost caps can prevent a propagation without changing
satisfiability. Without a lower bound on `y`, the forward example cannot
compute its upper bound by this interval calculation; another direction or
another row may still yield a consequence. A row wider than the size cap is
skipped. If the changed variable occurs in more rows than the fanout cap,
the scan skips all of them for that notification rather than taking a prefix.
The {source}`default caps <src/smt/check_sat.hpp#L173-L178>` are 64 terms/rows
for forward work and 32 for reverse work. Each target-atom query can rescan
the row, so the cost also depends on how many atoms index the affected variables.

{source}`The options <src/smt/check_sat.hpp#L245-L269>` enable same-variable
propagation by default; row propagation requires `lra_row_propagation`, and
the reverse direction additionally requires `lra_bidirectional_row_propagation`.
Both row options default to false and depend on `lra_propagation`. These
mechanisms do not perform complete arithmetic consequence discovery.

Dutertre–de Moura's technical report §3.2.5 describes both same-variable
propagation and row-bound refinement; applying it to an isolated row variable
gives the reverse rule above. Primo's atom indexing, triggers and caps are
implementation choices.
Bjørner and Nachmanson's [*Arithmetic Solving in Z3*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-65627-9_2)
(CAV 2024), §3.3, makes the same
direct/indirect propagation distinction. Primo's row mode queries implied
bounds to explain existing Boolean atoms; this does not mean it implements
every bound-refinement policy described for Z3.

For mixed Real problems, a proved comparison can also contribute to
[online shared-equality propagation](combination.md#online-equality-propagation):
assigned `x <= y` and `y <= x` justify `x = y`. The default
[tableau equality rules](#lra-default-equality-rules) are another producer,
with their own scheduling and completeness limits. These are separate from
guessing an equality because two current model values happen to coincide.

### Deferred consistency checks

The online propagator applies each assigned bound immediately but defers
simplex repair until a consistency check is needed. This batches `check()`
calls, not the bound updates themselves; deferred assignment updates remain
a different proposal. An immediate bound conflict must survive the deferred
check because the rejected bound never entered the tableau. See
{source}`notification and deferred repair <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7310-L7413>`.
Delivered propagation reasons remain available until their assignments are
removed, following the shared-assignment protocol in [DPLL(T)](dpllt.md).

(lra-soi)=
## Optional sum of infeasibilities

`--lra-pivoting-rule soi` selects **sum of infeasibilities (SOI)**. This mode
uses all current bound violations to guide a repair step. The ordinary
sparse policy remains the solver default. The algorithmic basis is
King, Barrett and Dutertre's
[Simplex with Sum of Infeasibilities for SMT](https://theory.stanford.edu/~barrett/pubs/KBD13.pdf),
FMCAD 2013, §V, and [King's thesis](https://cs.nyu.edu/media/publications/king_tim.pdf),
§§3.2–3.3. The implementation choices and departures are described below.

### The violation objective and its row

Write $\beta(x)$ for the current exact assignment, and $l(x)$ and $u(x)$
for the active bounds when present. Define the violation of a variable by

$$
v_\beta(x)=
\begin{cases}
l(x)-\beta(x), & \beta(x)<l(x),\\
\beta(x)-u(x), & \beta(x)>u(x),\\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\qquad
V(\beta)=\sum_x v_\beta(x).
$$

Only present bounds participate in these cases. Values and comparisons use
`DeltaRational`, so strict inequalities retain their infinitesimal part.
Nonbasic variables already satisfy their bounds; the error set $E$ consists
of violated basic variables. Thus $V(\beta)=0$ precisely when the current
assignment satisfies all bounds as well as the tableau equations.

The objective is piecewise linear: its slope changes when a variable reaches
a bound. For each basic variable $x_i$, let $d_i=-1$ when it is below its
lower bound, $d_i=+1$ when above its upper bound, and $d_i=0$ otherwise.
Substituting the basic rows gives a linear expression over nonbasic variables:

$$
f=\sum_{i\in E}d_i x_i
 =\sum_{j\in N}c_j x_j,
\qquad c_j=\sum_{i\in E}d_i a_{ij}.
$$

Here $N$ is the nonbasic set and $a_{ij}$ is the coefficient of $x_j$ in
row $x_i$. If $b_i$ is the bound currently violated by $x_i$, then
$V(\beta)=f(\beta)-\sum_{i\in E}d_i b_i$. The row for $f$ therefore records
the current linear part; evaluating it alone does not give the total violation.

{source}`LraTableau's SOI constructor <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.hpp#L246-L258>`
allocates an unbounded auxiliary basic variable `f_var_` and an initially empty
row. The tableau owns this row and the cached directions `soi_directions_`.
When a direction changes,
{source}`set_soi_direction <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L446-L501>`
adds $(d_i^{\mathrm{new}}-d_i^{\mathrm{old}})$ times that basic row to the objective row.
Bound assertion and assignment updates call this operation. A pivot removes
the leaving variable's contribution before rewriting the basis, and ordinary
row substitution rewrites the objective too. Once the pivot and assignment
update finish, the row must again equal the signed sum of the violated rows.
The selector uses its coefficients, rather than treating the auxiliary
variable's stored assignment as $V$.

### Selecting a step at a bound crossing

{source}`soi_select <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L517-L693>` considers
a nonbasic $x_j$ occurring in the objective row if it can move in the direction
that decreases $f$: decrease it when $c_j>0$, or increase it when $c_j<0$.
Its own lower or upper bound must leave room for that movement. The paper
calls these variables *flexible*.

Let $h$ be the proposed change to $\beta(x_j)$; this step is distinct from the
infinitesimal $\delta$. In a dependent row, the change to $\beta(x_i)$ is
$a_{ij}h$. Reaching a bound $b$ of that basic variable gives a **breakpoint**

$$
h=\frac{b-\beta(x_i)}{a_{ij}}.
$$

The selector collects lower- and upper-bound crossings in the chosen direction,
plus the entering variable's own bound if present. It sorts them by distance
along that direction and discards points beyond the entering variable's bound.
Basic variables may become violated along the walk; the chosen step is judged
by the sum of violations, while nonbasic variables remain within bounds.

The walk starts with slope $c_j$ and zero change in $V$. Between consecutive
breakpoints $h_{old}$ and $h_{new}$, a constant slope $m$ gives

$$
\Delta V(h_{new})=\Delta V(h_{old})+m(h_{new}-h_{old}).
$$

Crossing a basic bound changes that row's contribution to the slope by
$(d_i^{\mathrm{after}}-d_i^{\mathrm{before}})a_{ij}$. Coincident breakpoints are
processed together before continuing. Primo scores candidates with this walk
without temporarily changing the live tableau.

For a fixed entering variable, Primo chooses the breakpoint with the smallest
computed $\Delta V$, then the smallest $|h|$, then the smallest leaving-variable ID.
Across entering variables, it prefers a strict decrease over a zero change,
then the largest $|c_j|$, then the smallest entering ID. It does **not** compare
the size of the decrease across different entering variables.
Starting-bound crossings use the one-sided slope described below.

{source}`check's SOI loop <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L1731-L1795>`
applies the selected step. If the entering variable reaches its own bound,
it only updates that variable. Otherwise, Primo first pivots the selected
basic variable out, then sets it to the reached bound. This produces the same
final assignment as updating the entering variable and then pivoting it in.

### A worked pivot

The paper's Figure 6 starts with

$$
\begin{gathered}
x_1=2x_2-x_3,\\
3\le x_1\le7,\qquad x_2\le3,\qquad x_3\ge1,\\
\beta(x_1)=\beta(x_2)=\beta(x_3)=1.
\end{gathered}
$$

Only $x_1$ is violated, by two, so $f=-x_1=-2x_2+x_3$. Decreasing $x_3$
would help but its lower bound blocks that move. Increasing $x_2$ is possible.
The retained breakpoints for its step $h$ are:

| Step | Bound reached | Resulting values | Total violation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $h=1$ | $x_1=3$ | $x_1=3,\ x_2=2,\ x_3=1$ | $0$ |
| $h=2$ | $x_2=3$ | $x_1=5,\ x_2=3,\ x_3=1$ | $0$ |

The upper bound $x_1=7$ would give $h=3$, which Primo discards because it
would move $x_2$ beyond its own upper bound. Both retained steps remove the
violation, so the smaller step wins: $x_2$ enters and $x_1$ leaves. Solving
the row for $x_2$ gives $x_2=(x_1+x_3)/2$. Setting the now-nonbasic $x_1=3$
therefore sets $x_2=2$, and all bounds hold after one pivot.

The {source}`worked-example regression <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L781-L829>`
checks the resulting basis and values. It adds $x_2\ge1$ to establish the
initial assignment through the public bound API; that extra bound does not
restrict the increasing walk used here.

### Combining rows into a conflict

If the objective has no flexible variable and $E$ is empty, `check()` succeeds.
If $E$ is nonempty, the current assignment minimizes the linear expression
$f$ using the nonbasic bounds, but still has positive violation. This proves
a conflict that may need several rows.

For example, consider two basic rows and three asserted atoms:

```text
s1 = x + y       p: s1 <= -1
s2 = x - y       q: s2 <= -1
                r: x >= 0
```

At the all-zero assignment both upper bounds are violated. Their directions
are $+1$, so $f=s_1+s_2=2x$. Decreasing $x$ is blocked by `r`, and $y$
cancels from the objective. The rows and `r` imply $s_1+s_2\ge0$, whereas
`p` and `q` require $s_1+s_2\le-2$. The explanation clause is
`¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r`. Each basic row alone could be repaired by moving $y$;
their combination exposes why both cannot be repaired together.

More generally, for a nonempty subset $S$ of the current error set, form
$f_S=\sum_{i\in S}d_i x_i=\sum_j c_j x_j$. If this restricted row has no
flexible variable, each positive coefficient is blocked at its lower bound
and each negative coefficient at its upper bound. These bounds establish

$$
f_S\ \ge\ \sum_{c_j>0}c_j l(x_j)+\sum_{c_j<0}c_j u(x_j)
\ =\ f_S(\beta)\ >\ \sum_{i\in S}d_i b_i.
$$

The last inequality holds because every variable in $S$ has positive
violation. Its selected bound requires $d_i x_i\le d_i b_i$, so those bounds
together contradict the displayed lower bound on $f_S$.
{source}`build_soi_conflict <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L700-L742>`
collects the blocking nonbasic-bound reasons and each selected violated-bound
reason. They already have their clause signs, as in the
[single-row explanation](#follow-a-strict-conflict).

### Shrinking the explanation

The initial set $E$ can include unrelated conflicts. The default
{source}`QuickXplain-style minimizer <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L744-L814>`
recursively splits the candidate error variables, trying one half against a
background containing the other. Its test rebuilds the restricted row $f_S$
and checks for a flexible variable; the empty set is explicitly rejected.
It searches for a smaller conflict in the **current assignment and basis**,
without another simplex search.

`--lra-soi-minimize deletion` instead
{source}`tries removing one row at a time <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L816-L886>`
and keeps a removal only when the remaining set still passes that conflict
test. `--lra-soi-minimize-order` controls its visit order: `id` uses increasing
IDs, `row-support` tries longer rows first, and `violation` tries larger
violations first. This option has no effect on the default `quickxplain` or
on `none`, which retains all error variables.

This is heuristic explanation reduction, without a guarantee of a globally
smallest clause. Removing a row changes the coefficients of $f_S$ and can
expose or cancel nonbasic variables. The result contains a reason for each
selected violated bound **and** each nonzero coefficient's blocking bound;
minimizing the number of selected rows does not necessarily minimize the
number of clause literals.

### Cost, termination and implemented scope

Primo follows the paper's violation objective, breakpoint walk and multi-row
conflict derivation. It makes several concrete choices:

- The walk considers only the direction that initially decreases $f$, as
  permitted by §V-A, and keeps the entering variable within its own bounds.
  It scans every flexible variable in the objective row. For each candidate
  it scans dependent rows to find coefficients, sorts the breakpoints, and
  scans rows again at crossings. Sorting $k$ points costs $O(k\log k)$
  comparisons, in addition to those row scans and exact arithmetic.
- The objective update merges and sorts the old objective row with a signed
  basic row. This can cost more than an ordinary repair step, especially
  when the objective accumulates many nonzero coefficients.
- Unlike the paper's §V-C rule, Primo retains the coefficient preference
  between entering variables even when the best steps make no progress.
  It instead bounds the SOI prefix using the
  {source}`finite fallback settings <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.hpp#L223-L237>`:
  by default `4 * variable_count + 64`. The local counter counts selected
  SOI steps, including updates without a pivot. Once it exceeds the threshold,
  ordinary Bland repair handles the rest of that `check()` call. The threshold
  does not cap the total work or make the result `unknown`.
- The minimizer uses the restricted-row test described in §V-B and King's
  §3.3.5. It does not implement the thesis's Figure 3.6 row-selection loop,
  which grows a conflicting subset using coefficient signs before recursive
  reduction. Deletion and its orderings are additional Primo choices.
- The SOI selector does not run Figure 5's preliminary `CheckAllConflicts`
  scan. It detects direct contradictory bounds during assertion and builds
  a row-combination conflict when its objective has no flexible variable;
  ordinary row-conflict checking also remains available after fallback.
- SOI also maintains its objective during bound assertion and SAT rollback.
  Its extra trail state is described [below](#rollback-and-model-values).

```{admonition} Starting exactly on a bound
:class: note

At step zero, a variable on a bound has direction zero. Moving into its
feasible interval leaves that direction unchanged; moving out changes it
to `+1` at an upper bound or `-1` at a lower bound. `SoiBreakPoint` retains
the bound kind so the {source}`slope update <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L638-L665>`
can distinguish these cases. A fixed variable has two coincident events but
contributes only once at zero.
At a nonzero crossing, passing through its fixed value still changes the
direction from `-1` to `+1`, or conversely, and contributes twice.

For a concrete example, start at zero with `s = x + y`, `t = x - y`,
`y = 0`, `s >= 1`, and `t >= 0`. Only `s` is violated, giving
`f = -x - y`. Increasing `x` by one removes the violation, while `t` moves
inside its feasible interval. Its zero-length lower-bound event leaves the
slope at `-1`, and the step of one repairs the assignment in one pivot.

The earlier implementation incorrectly changed the slope to `0` at that
starting event, scored the step of one as making no improvement, and selected
a zero-step pivot first. The historical two-pivot diagnostic is recorded as
`2026-09-28-soi-zero-breakpoint-debug` in the
{download}`run log bundled with this draft <../run-log.json>`.
The {download}`retained reproduction <../examples/soi-zero-step.cpp>` now
asserts a single pivot and the same final values `x = 1`, `y = 0`.
Dedicated tableau regressions cover inward/outward motion, both coefficient
signs and walk directions, coincident fixed bounds, infinitesimal steps,
and replay after rollback. The older Figure 6 regression remains separate.
```

Existing tests cover the worked pivot, rollback, reduction of independent
conflicts, and the selectable minimization strategies. Counters distinguish
multi-row conflicts, minimizer calls, reductions in the error set, emitted
reason literals, and Bland fallbacks. A smaller error set alone is not evidence
of faster solving.

The {source}`run log <docs/run-log.json>` preserves dated SOI evidence:

| Record | Result and limitation |
| --- | --- |
| `2026-07-25-qf-lra-soi-simplex-quick-eval`, `fc06922` | SOI and Bland solved the same 7 of 17 instances at a five-second limit. This was a local exploratory comparison without committed raw artifacts. |
| `2026-07-25-qf-lra-soi-simplex-slurm-smoke-gate`, `bcdf7ef` | Of 500 generated cases, 324 passed and 176 timed out; no crashes or wrong answers were reported. This is historical partial coverage, below today's merge-gate count. |
| `2026-08-10-soi-minimization-arms-measured`, `8ddd62d` | A selected 18-instance local comparison measured reason-literal counts for five strategies. No deletion ordering consistently improved on QuickXplain; runtime/PAR2 was not evaluated. |

These records explain the retained experiments, but do not qualify the current
revision or establish a speed advantage. SOI remains opt-in, with QuickXplain
as its default minimizer.

The correction's fresh SOI fuzz gate generated 1,000 distinct QF_LRA inputs:
958 agreed with Z3 and 42 timed out at five seconds, including two mutual
timeouts. It found no wrong answers, crashes or input rejections. See
`2026-09-29-soi-endpoint-correction` in the bundled run log for qualification
and limits; this is not a new overall performance claim.

## Rollback and model values

`push()` returns an undo-trail position. With the default sparse policy,
{source}`pop <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L1896-L1966>` restores
bounds and rebuilds the set of violated basic variables. It retains the
current basis and assignment. Relaxing bounds preserves nonbasic feasibility,
and the assignment still satisfies the retained equations. Basic feasibility
is established by `check()`, not by the act of popping alone.

This is an implementation choice within the fixed-equation approach. The
technical report §3.2.4 describes saving a successful assignment;
Bromberger §7.1.3 compares that with keeping the current assignment and
rechecking. Primo neither restores an old assignment against a changed basis
nor unconditionally runs `check()` inside `pop()`. SAT decision rollback and
SMT-LIB assertion scopes remain different operations. The latter's reuse
design is described in the {source}`retained LRA session note <docs/assumption-incremental-lra.md>`.

The [SOI objective](#lra-soi) depends on which basic variables currently
violate which bounds. Restoring bounds alone would leave its cached directions
and row describing the abandoned state. Primo therefore trails assignments,
pivoted rows, and objective changes in SOI mode, as selected by
{source}`trails_assignments_and_pivots <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.hpp#L843>`.
Each {source}`FRowTrailEntry <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.hpp#L790-L800>`
saves the previous objective row together with the changed variable's previous
direction. Undo restores both, and `pop` rebuilds the occurrence index after
row restoration and the violated-variable set after all undo operations.
This is Primo's current restoration strategy; an alternative could recompute
the objective from the retained basis and restored bounds.

For a satisfying Real model,
{source}`choose_concrete_delta <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L3516-L3561>`
finds a positive rational small enough to preserve the assigned bounds and
evaluates `q + k*δ` at that value. Where a crossing point limits `δ`, it
chooses half the smallest positive limit; otherwise it uses one. Mixed
theory model construction additionally preserves required shared-value
orders. Reconstruction of eliminated variables and Boolean values remains
part of the model builder; a feasible tableau alone is not the printed model.

(equalities-for-combination)=
(propagating-equalities-between-shared-variables)=
### Propagating equalities between variables

The default QF_UFLRA producer uses four rules based on fixed variables and
matching tableau rows. Their worked examples, bound explanations, and
incompleteness are described in
[the combination chapter](#lra-default-equality-rules). That chapter also gives
the [model-mutation schedule](combination.md#when-model-mutation-runs): the
dedicated Real route attempts scratch diversification before its final
equality-exchange passes and model reconciliation.

Bjørner and Nachmanson's *Arithmetic Solving in Z3*, §3.2, also informs an
optional equality producer for QF_UFLRA. Starting from a feasible tableau,
{source}`model_filtered_unit_equalities <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L1265-L1460>`
groups shared variables by their exact current value. It then looks for
equalities justified by bounds and equations. Two variables fixed to the same
value are equal. For variables related by rows, it checks two shapes:

- `x = y + r`, where every variable in the remainder `r` is fixed by matching
  lower and upper bounds. If `x` and `y` have equal current values, `r` is
  zero and remains zero while those bounds hold.
- `x = s*z + r₁` and `y = s*z + r₂`, where the shared coefficient `s` is
  `1` or `-1` and both remainders contain only fixed variables. Equal current
  values of `x` and `y` establish that the fixed remainders are equal too.

Current values filter candidate pairs; the bounds fixing the remainders
supply the explanations. This avoids constructing the large rational offsets
used by the older producer. The method emits an equality only when it connects
previously separate groups; transitivity supplies the remaining connections.
The surrounding combination solver retains its exact fallback checks.

This is the `model-unit` option. The
{source}`default remains legacy <src/smt/check_sat.hpp#L396-L402>`; by default,
pure QF_LRA calls neither producer. The full-corpus comparisons and the unpromoted
adaptive follow-up are preserved in the
{source}`2024 paper implementation note <docs/papers/arithmetic-solving-in-z3.md#L280-L464>`.
The paper's integer and nonlinear procedures are outside this chapter's scope.

(experimental-pure-arithmetic-equality-propagation)=
#### Experimental pure-arithmetic equality propagation

The default-off `--lra-equality-propagation` experiment reuses the §3.2 model-unit
recognizer on pure QF_LRA. This deliberately changes the scope: the paper
explicitly disables this discovery pass for pure QF_LRA/QF_LIA. It is a
portfolio experiment, not a claim that the paper recommends this setting.
It requires IPASIR-UP and works independently of `--lra-propagation`.
Retained sessions keep their existing option restrictions: monotone elimination
is forbidden in assumptions mode, so the combined phase/elimination/equality
profile is a one-shot configuration.
The {equalityexperiment}`consumer index <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7217-L7245>`,
{equalityexperiment}`feasible-state scan <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7561-L7634>`,
and {equalityexperiment}`backtrack repair <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7031-L7068>`
are separate from the existing tableau recognizer described above.
The implementation follows this checklist:

- The pure `solve_qf_lra_impl` path enables the feature explicitly on its
  `OnlineLraPropagator`, as does the retained `IncrementalLraEngine` when it
  constructs the per-query propagator. Mixed routes and defaults keep their
  existing behavior.
- The propagator owns an immutable index of existing comparison atoms whose
  canonical polynomial is `x - y`, and the original arithmetic variable IDs.
  It creates no terms, SAT variables, tableau rows, or all-pairs atom frontier.
  With no indexed targets, it leaves the scan and extra repair scheduling inactive.
- After an arithmetic assignment or backtrack, repair feasibility before
  querying `LraTableau::model_filtered_unit_equalities`. Equal model values
  alone never justify a propagation. No scan runs again until the state changes.
- Join the returned explained edges into components. The union of the bound
  premises on a component's edges justifies equality of any two members;
  these reasons may be larger than a minimal path explanation.
- For an indexed atom whose endpoints are proved equal, evaluate its comparison
  at `x - y = 0` and queue the corresponding SAT literal with those premises.
  An opposite assignment produces a guarded conflict. Existing propagation
  reason lifetimes and backtrack removal apply to delivered literals.
- Discovery costs a model grouping and candidate-row scan; component building
  and target lookup add linear traversal plus disjoint-set work. Materializing
  component explanations adds `O(sum_c R_c log R_c)` sorting work for `R_c`
  collected reason literals in each component; deduplication and copying
  reasons to target atoms add work proportional to their sizes. There is no completeness
  claim: row shapes, the current basis, and existing target atoms restrict it.
- Test fixed equalities, both unit connector signs, accidental model equality,
  strict and scaled/reversed comparisons, transitive edges, backtracking and
  model construction. Qualify on CPU SLURM with fresh differential fuzzing and
  real-seed mutations, then compare default/option and both-flags/option on
  all 1,753 inputs with separate direct SAT-model validation. Report complementary
  solves, not only aggregate runtime. No default or performance claim is made
  before these checks complete.

For example, bounds `x >= 7`, `x <= 7`, `y >= 7`, `y <= 7` prove `x = y`.
Their four premise literals justify an existing `x <= y` atom being true or an
existing `x < y` atom being false. Scaled and reversed comparisons use the
same normalized difference slack. The index excludes expressions such as
`2*x - y`, whose value is not determined by equality alone. Internal bounds
are updated only when SAT assigns the propagated atom, following the existing
notification protocol. The new unit regressions exercise transitive component
reasons, strict/scaled targets, accidental model equality, and conditional
fixing premises; the existing tableau regressions cover the unit-row shapes.
The frozen `4419dc9` implementation passed the generated, real-seed mutation,
retained-session and sanitizer gates recorded in run
`2026-10-21-pure-lra-equality-portfolio`. Full-corpus timings and their separate
SAT-model replay are still running. Preliminary profiling locates substantial
overhead in repeated discovery scans: many explained edges can produce very
few new target literals. The implementation currently scans even when its
indexed targets are already assigned and may queue duplicate candidates;
delivery skips assigned candidates. This is a performance limitation, not
evidence of extra pivoting or an invalid explanation. Defaults remain unchanged.

## Fixed-basic elimination

When the lower and upper bounds of a basic variable become equal, its value is
fixed while those bounds hold. With fixed elimination enabled,
{source}`try_eliminate_fixed_basic <src/theory/arithmetic/lra_tableau.cpp#L393-L431>`
pivots that variable out of the basis, then updates the now-nonbasic variable
to its fixed value. Dependent rows receive the corresponding assignment update.
A variable fixed at both bounds cannot be a useful entering candidate while
those bounds remain in force.

For example, if the row is $s=x+y$ and bounds fix $s=3$, pivoting on $x$ gives
$x=s-y$. Setting the nonbasic $s$ to 3 makes the equality explicit in the
assignment without repeatedly selecting a violated fixed basic row. This is
a basis change, not deletion of the original variable or its explanation.
When a bound is undone, ordinary bound rollback and feasibility repair apply;
the basis need not return to its original shape.

The operation runs from basic-variable bound assertion. An empty row is left
for the ordinary consistency check, because forcing a nonzero value onto its
constant-zero expression can be a real conflict. A row without an admissible
entering variable is also left unchanged. The rule preserves bound reasons and
does not implement the full column-deletion/restoration pipeline of LP presolve.

The {source}`H7 design <docs/qf-lra-heuristics.md#L539-L736>` records the
original adaptation and the rejected row-freezing extension. Current defaults
are off for pure LRA and on for the dedicated mixed Real route, as declared in
{source}`CheckSatOptions <src/smt/check_sat.hpp#L295-L310>`. Compare elimination
pivots, later repair work and total runtime; fewer fixed basic rows alone is
not a performance conclusion. The [evidence summary](../evidence/arithmetic.md)
preserves the distinct pure/mixed evaluations.

The {source}`fixed-elimination regression <tests/unit/qf_lra_solver_tests.cpp#L4549-L4565>`
checks SAT and UNSAT examples with the option both enabled and disabled, and
requires nonzero elimination counters when enabled.

## Model phase hints

`--lra-model-phase` lets the arithmetic assignment suggest a Boolean polarity
for an arithmetic atom. If the current tableau assigns $x=2$, it recommends
the positive literal for $x\leq3$ and the negative literal for $x<1$.
This is a search preference: the current assignment is not a proof that either
literal follows from the asserted constraints.

{source}`model_phase_literal <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7415-L7430>` tests
the prepared bound, including its strict/integer normalization, against the
`DeltaRational` assignment. Equality relations are skipped. The selected
literal is passed to the SAT backend's phase interface; SAT still selects its
decision variable and may choose a different search path.

The online propagator tracks which tableau assignments may have changed, so
local updates need refresh only their affected atoms; a pivot can require a
full refresh.
Refresh waits for a conflict-free state, and
{source}`refresh_model_phase_atom <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7459-L7473>`
avoids resending an unchanged hint. Hints may become stale between refresh and
the later SAT decision; no theory lemma is justified by their value.

The adapter delivers these preferences through CaDiCaL's `phase` API, which
forces a variable's default decision phase; it is not a one-decision callback.
Primo exposes no matching `unphase` operation. The
[full-corpus regression investigation](../evidence/lra-regressions.md)
records the resulting search risks and separates arithmetic work from refresh
overhead. It does not establish stale phases as the cause of those losses.

SPASS-SATT §3 and footnote 3 describe arithmetic decision recommendations
{cite:p}`bromberger2019spass`. Primo tests whether the assignment satisfies each
atom and updates its phase, rather than using the paper's immediate `GetPhase`
callback. It does
not replace SAT variable selection or implement a new entailment test here.
The option remains off by default. The
[dated arithmetic comparison](../evidence/arithmetic.md#different-routes-can-justify-different-choices)
records gains and losses separately by logic.

The {source}`phase-refresh regression <tests/unit/qf_lra_solver_tests.cpp#L3605-L3633>`
forces a bound update to change the recommended phase, then checks that hints
are refreshed and disappear when the option is disabled.

their own settings and measurement scope. Exact table-to-artifact mapping
remains open.

control, batched assignment updates and
[floating-point-guided basis selection](../leads/lra-floating-point.md). The

hypotheses and the measurements that would support or reject them.

Robert Daniel Brummayer's *Efficient SMT Solving for Bit-Vectors and the
Extensional Theory of Arrays* (PhD thesis, JKU Linz, September 2009),
Chapter 4, informs the grammar-based fuzzing and failure reduction described
in the [contributor correctness guide](../development/correctness.md#fuzzing-and-reduction-sources).

## Invariants exercised by existing tests

| Obligation | Regression or mechanism test |
| --- | --- |
| Exact promotion/demotion preserves arithmetic, equality and hashing | {source}`rational representation and GMP comparison tests <tests/unit/rational_tests.cpp#L272-L383>` |
| A strict boundary cannot be rounded into a satisfying equality | {source}`strict-bound conflict test <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L177-L197>` |
| Sparse pricing finds candidates and really uses occurrence counts | {source}`sparse selection tests <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L533-L625>` |
| Heuristic repair eventually invokes the counted Bland fallback | {source}`Bland fallback test <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L725-L753>` |
| Rows stay sorted; cancelled coefficients lose their occurrences | {source}`row/occurrence tests <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L1333-L1522>` |
| Rollback preserves equation consistency; SOI restores its extra state | {source}`ordinary rollback tests <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L238-L416>` and {source}`SOI rollback <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L992-L1029>` |
| Shared polynomials preserve scaled thresholds and flipped strictness | {source}`preparation tests <tests/unit/qf_lra_solver_tests.cpp#L4363-L4450>` |
| Propagation has a Boolean effect and respects configured caps | {source}`same-variable/row propagation tests <tests/unit/qf_lra_solver_tests.cpp#L3268-L3447>` |
| Reverse row propagation derives another variable's bound and can lead to conflict | {source}`reverse-direction regressions <tests/unit/qf_lra_solver_tests.cpp#L3449-L3535>` |
| SOI exercises the paper's worked pivot example | {source}`SOI worked-example test <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L798-L829>` |
| Starting-bound slopes distinguish inward/outward motion and count fixed bounds correctly | {source}`SOI endpoint regressions <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L831-L954>` cover both signs, infinitesimal steps and rollback. |
| SOI reduction can discard unrelated conflicting rows | {source}`independent-conflict minimization test <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L1066-L1106>` |
| SOI strategies return asserted reasons; deletion order affects clause length | {source}`minimization strategy tests <tests/unit/lra_tableau_tests.cpp#L2621-L2698>` |

Performance investigations additionally use pivot, row-update, term-operation,
Bland-fallback and propagation counters; their publication is visible in
{source}`run_deferred_check_if_needed <src/smt/solver_engines.cpp#L7379-L7413>`.
Correctness qualification still requires the fresh fuzzing and independent
model checks described in the [contributor guide](../development/correctness.md).
