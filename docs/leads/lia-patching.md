# Configurable and better-guided integer patching

**Status: Open lead. Owner: unassigned.**

Replace the unexplained fixed search width with an explicit parameter, then
investigate candidate selection and progress measures from integer programming.
The [primary-source survey](../papers/lia-primal-heuristics.md) covers rounding
and shifting, the feasibility pump, and RENS. These are candidate experiments;
no new option or heuristic is implemented by this documentation change.

## Baseline and parameter contract

{source}`integer_targets <src/theory/arithmetic/lia_patching.cpp#L17-L43>`
currently sets `kTargetWindow = 4`. For floor $m$, it generates
$m,m+1,m-1,m+2,m-2,m+3,m-3,m+4$, then stably orders them by distance from
the rational part. This window was not benchmark-tuned. The existing
`--lia-patch-limit` limits **accepted moves**, not target distance or scoring
work.

Propose `--lia-patch-window=N`, with positive integer $N$ and default $4$,
generating $m-k,m+k+1$ for $0\le k<N$. Retain the current order and ties at
the default. Keep disabling patching under `--lia-patch-limit=0`; reject
zero for the new window to avoid two disabling conventions. Specify a checked
range and an allocation/work bound before accepting arbitrary user values.
Thread the option through both QF_LIA and QF_UFLIA, and report its effective
value in reproducible experiments. This is a proposed interface, pending
implementation and qualification.

## Comparisons worth making

Start with configurable fixed windows as a controlled baseline, then compare:

1. **Reachable candidates.** Map the moved variable's freedom interval to the
   target row's reachable values, and generate admissible integers directly.
   Account for coefficient sign and exact strict endpoints.
2. **Adaptive widening and arithmetic structure.** Widen only after the cheap
   search fails, under a candidate/row-visit budget. Investigate steps that
   preserve integrality in several affected rows: in $y=x/2,z=x/3$, multiples
   of $6$ satisfy both. A general congruence-based generator needs its own
   derivation for rational coefficients, offsets and bounded intervals; it is
   an inference for Primo, not an implemented algorithm from the surveyed papers.
3. **A more informative progress score.** Compare the current count of
   fractional variables with fractionality-guided feasible moves, motivated
   by ZI Round in Achterberg–Berthold–Hendel §2. A smaller rational distance
   is not a finite termination argument. Specify work limits, cycles and
   handling of a pure infinitesimal before permitting count-preserving moves.
4. **Joint moves.** If single-variable progress stalls, compare a small
   RENS-style neighborhood with continued unrestricted branching. Limit its
   nodes and discard failed neighborhoods; their extra fixings do not justify
   an UNSAT answer. Nearest joint roundings still miss some distant solutions.

Temporary-infeasibility repair and a feasibility pump are larger alternatives.
The pump requires minimizing an LP distance objective; the current feasibility
checker is not that operation. Keep these behind evidence that the cheaper
experiments leave a material, reachable gap.

## Representation and acceptance criteria

Use the private integer-completion `LraTableau` and explicit `integer_vars`.
The current `PatchingScoringIndex` is valid only while row incidence stays
unchanged. Any pivoting variant must rebuild or maintain it. A returned
candidate must satisfy every tableau bound and integer obligation and pass
the caller's ordinary model checks. Heuristic failure continues to GCD,
cuts and branching; it never certifies infeasibility.

Preserve the {source}`existing patching regressions
<tests/unit/lia_patching_tests.cpp>` and add distant-target, plateau,
multi-variable and failed-neighborhood cases derived from the selected rules.
Record window, move/work budgets, seeds and fallback behavior. Use existing
candidate/affected-row counters and add rejection or budget counters only
where they distinguish the variants.

Evaluate matched configurations on representative QF_LIA and QF_UFLIA families
under SLURM, including SAT, UNSAT, `unknown` and timeout cases. Compare total
time, solved counts, integer model hits and downstream branch nodes; reducing
the fractional count alone is not a win. Fresh fuzzing and independent model
validation are correctness gates. Keep the default window at $4$ until a
different policy has both correctness evidence and a measured overall benefit.
